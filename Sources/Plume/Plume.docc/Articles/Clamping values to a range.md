# Clamping values to a range

Learn about the various means of clamping a value.

## Overview

Plume provides a number of methods for restricting ``Swift/Comparable``-conforming values to a given range. You can clamp values to a given range using ``Clamping/clamp(_:)``, or clamp a given value to various ranges using ``Swift/Comparable/clamped(to:)``. You can also ensure that a property or variable is within a given range using the ``Clamped`` property wrapper.
